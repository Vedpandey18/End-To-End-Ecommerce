### E-Commerce Application: Overview

I developed a comprehensive e-commerce application using Java Spring Boot and React.js. The project was designed to handle operations such as managing product categories, orders, shopping carts, user authentication, and payment processing. The architecture emphasized modularity and scalability, with a strong focus on following best practices in API design and implementing robust security measures.

### Key Features and Functionalities:
1. **Product Management**: 
   - Handled product categories and relationships.
   - Implemented CRUD operations for products with pagination and sorting.

2. **User Management**: 
   - Managed user profiles, roles, and addresses for order shipping.
   - Built custom authentication mechanisms and integrated JWT-based security.

3. **Order and Cart Management**:
   - Developed modules for shopping cart operations, including adding, updating, and removing items.
   - Supported order creation, payment processing, and order history tracking.

4. **Frontend Development**: 
   - Designed an interactive user interface using React.js, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.
   - Integrated RESTful APIs to enable frontend-backend communication.

5. **Security**: 
   - Secured endpoints using Spring Security with JWT tokens.
   - Implemented role-based access control for sensitive operations.

6. **Database Management**: 
   - Used PostgreSQL and MySQL for data persistence.
   - Designed entity relationships with JPA and ensured data consistency.

### Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot (Spring Framework, Spring Security, JPA, Lombok)
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with custom validation and error handling
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication and custom mechanisms
- **Development Enhancements**: Lombok for reducing boilerplate code, Spring Boot annotations for simplified configuration.

### Development Highlights:
- **Annotations in Spring**: Leveraged Spring annotations to streamline dependency injection, request mapping, and component configuration.
- **Pagination and Sorting**: Built efficient APIs for listing products and orders with pagination and sorting capabilities.
- **Entity Relationships**: Implemented complex relationships between entities such as users, orders, and products using JPA.
- **Role Management**: Assigned user-specific roles to control application access dynamically.
- **Custom Validation**: Added tailored validations for user inputs to ensure data integrity and improve the user experience.

This project showcases, design and implement a full-stack application, seamlessly integrating backend APIs with a dynamic frontend while ensuring scalability, performance, and security.
